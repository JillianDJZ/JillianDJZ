- 👋 Hi, I’m @JillianDJZ
- 👀 I enjoy solving problems, excited and satisfied when code running successfully. I also like the way software development works, it breaks big tasks into small pieces, which gives me confidence in solving any problem.
- 🌱 I have graduated from UC at the end of 2022 with Bachelor of Science majoring in Computer Science.
- 💞️ I have a three-month software engineer internship experience in Seequent, and I have the opportunity to get a permanent position, but I gave up because of family relocation.
- 💞️ In February 2023, I joined FNZ and became an analysis developer until now.
- 📫 How to reach me: jillian.zhou2017@gmail.com
