- 👋 Hi, I’m @JillianDJZ
- 👀 I love solving problems, excited and satisfied when my code can run successfully. I also like the way software development works, it breaks big tasks into small pieces, which gives me confidence in solving any problem.
- 🌱 I am in the final year of my bachelor's degree in computer science in  the UC.
- 💞️ I am applying for a long term role as a software developer.
- 📫 How to reach me: jillian.zhou2017@gmail.com
